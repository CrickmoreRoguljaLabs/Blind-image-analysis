# Blind-image-analysis
A simple package to blind images and quantify signal intensities
By Stephen Zhang

To blind images: run batchblind and select any image in the the folder. The blinded images will be in a "Blinded" subfolder with key stored in a .mat file.

To select ROIs: run ROIselect and select any images in the folder. By default, the program asks to select the ROI and then background for each image.

To quantify: Make sure the ROIs are loaded and run batchquantify.
